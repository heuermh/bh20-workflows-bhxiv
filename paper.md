# Introduction

As part of the one week COVID-19 Biohackathion 2020, we formed a
working group on ... yeah Workflows!


<!--

## Collaboration with other BioHackathon 2020 topic groups

With the public sequence resource group of the COVID-19 BioHackathon
we collaborated by adding CWL workflows to their pipelines, e.g.  to
convert FASTQ to FASTA and on to GFA. These workflows were converted
from existing WDL and NextFlow pipelines. New workflows were also
developed in this collaboration, such as conversion from GFA to RDF
where input metadata got merged with that of the GFA graph.
